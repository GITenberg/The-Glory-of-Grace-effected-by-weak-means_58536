<blockquote><p>Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou
ordained strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest
still the enemy and the avenger.&nbsp; <i>Psalm</i> viii, 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> David had his mind most
divinely elevated and filled with holy thoughts of the person,
work, and glory of the dear Redeemer, he burst forth in holy
admiration, joy, and praise, in this adoring language: I will
extol thee, my God, O king!&nbsp; I will bless thy name for ever
and ever!&nbsp; One generation shall praise thy works unto
another, and shall declare thy mighty acts: and surely the most
wonderful and astonishing act, is the everlasting salvation of
lost, ruined, guilty man.&nbsp; This is a greater act than the
formation of worlds, either heaven or earth.&nbsp; The salvation
of one poor sinner is a more marvellous display of God, than the
creation, with all its wonders.&nbsp; This salvation we are to
speak of to others, both ministers and people; and in proportion
as we see our interest in it, so are we to declare its greatness,
because it is the highest act of God, as the God of all grace,
and</p>
<blockquote><p>Why should the wonders he has wrought<br />
Be lost in silence and forgot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But babes, men, and children, let them praise the name of the
Lord.</p>
<p>I could wish this task, on this solemn, and to me, painful
occasion, had devolved on one suitable, but supported by the
Lord&rsquo;s presence, upheld by his power, and <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>cheered with
his approbation in my mind, I humbly attempt to rehearse the
wonders of his love, the riches of his grace, and the displays of
his mercy to me, and mine, and attempt, in my poor way, to prove
the glorious truth in the text: Out of the mouths of babes God
has ordained his own glory, the glory of his <i>love</i>, his
<i>grace</i>, his <i>mercy</i>, his <i>truth</i>, his
<i>power</i>, his <i>faithfulness</i>, and infinite
<i>condescension</i>.&nbsp; It is true that I can do no justice
to the important words, by way of a Sermon.&nbsp; They contain a
vast store of rich truth and precious experience.&nbsp; I must
therefore merely glance at the meaning, and shew, in as concise a
manner as I can, to whom they belong, and to whom they will, with
scriptural propriety, apply.</p>
<p>The title of this psalm is to the chief musician upon Gittith,
a psalm of David.&mdash;Various are the conjectures of learned
men on this title.&nbsp; Some think the word Gittith signifies
the wine press, and the title means, To the conqueror over the
trodden wine press, wrath; and if so, we are not at a loss to
know to whom it belongs.&nbsp; A psalm of, or concerning the
beloved one, to whom be glory.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>The ever blessed Redeemer is the subject of this psalm.&nbsp;
Hence we find it quoted in the New Testament, and twice applied
to him.&nbsp; It is a revelation of Christ, as God-man, in his
headship, his empire, dominion, and excellent name, his
royalties, majesty, and glory, with his union, relation, and
interest in his people.&nbsp; It is addressed to him as Jehovah,
the covenant God of the church; as one of the glorious and divine
persons, subsisting in the divine essence, with the Father and
the holy Spirit, the incomprehensible God, the most high God,
blessed for evermore; the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the
first and the last.&nbsp; If the first, there were none before <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>him, and if the
last, there can be none after him.&nbsp; He is the Almighty,
himself has declared it; the true God and eternal life,
possessing every divine and glorious perfection, the maker of
heaven and earth, the centre, the foundation, the glory, the
beauty, and ornament of creation; and the whole is sustained by
him&mdash;he is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, eternal,
unchangeable&mdash;the adorable I am, that I am!&mdash;and as God
in covenant, as well as absolute deity, he is called our God,
your God, their God, my Lord, and my God, the most mighty, the
great God, the living God; and must not that person have
diabolical effrontery to deny the essential and eternal Godhead
of the Lord Jesus Christ?&nbsp; Such conduct clearly demonstrates
that such persons are in nature&rsquo;s thickest gloom, nor can
those characters give the church or the world any scriptural
account of the holy Spirit&rsquo;s work upon their hearts.&nbsp;
We, therefore, can never allow such unconverted persons to be
proper judges of any one truth in divine revelation.&nbsp; When
persons are called by divine grace, they are brought to feel
their need of just such a saviour as Christ is, and are led to
prize the infinite value of his blood, the merit of his
obedience, the power of his arm, and the love of his heart.&nbsp;
But amidst the host of enemies to the person and dignity of
Christ, we humbly and gratefully unite with the Psalmist: Oh
Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, thy
perfections, and thy gospel, wherever it has been carried.&nbsp;
And how glorious it will be in the new heavens and earth, during
the millennium, his thousand years personal reign with his
people.&nbsp; There <i>he</i> has set his glory above the
heavens, his everlasting love, his holy humanity; and his church,
as considered in himself, are exalted above the &aelig;rial or
starry heavens.&nbsp; This is his glory, the joy of the redeemed,
the wonder of elect angels, and the envy of devils.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>The
Psalmist, having been led to adore Jehovah Jesus, as God in
covenant, and as God-man, the brightness of the Father&rsquo;s
glory, is sweetly brought on to view him in his humiliation,
final victory, and exaltation; and while considering the heavenly
bodies, their glory and greatness, with his own insufficiency to
celebrate his power, he yet adores him for that knowledge with
which his mind was favored, and exclaims, What is man that thou
art mindful of him?&nbsp; This passage is quoted by the apostle,
and the whole of it is applied to Christ, as the mediator, as the
Son of man, admiring that grace which conferred so great an honor
upon him, as to choose his individual nature, his humanity, as to
unite it with the Godhead, that he should prepare it in the
covenant, anoint it with the oil of gladness above his fellows,
delight in it, exalt it, and take such providential care of it;
support it under his direful sorrows, raise it, and give it
glory.&nbsp; Thus the sacred Messiah is represented, as filled
with holy and admiring thoughts of the subject, and in extacy
asks, What is man? the human nature made a little lower than God,
but next unto him, and in personal union with the Son of God; a
little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, but
crowned with glory and honor, as the whole election of grace, and
as the mediator of reconciliation.&nbsp; Christ by delegation,
hath universal dominion over all things, visible and invisible,
nature, providence, grace, glory, earth, and hell; and this will
ever form a subject for the admiration of God&rsquo;s
people.&nbsp; O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all
the earth! for as thou hast formed thy people for thy praise,
thou hast ordained the wonders of thy grace shall be celebrated
by them in time and eternity.&nbsp; Out of the mouths of babes
and sucklings thou hast ordained strength, because of thine
enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>We may
consider these words as justly applicable to 1. David.&nbsp; 2,
David&rsquo;s Lord.&mdash;3, The children of the temple.&nbsp; 4,
The apostles in their minority.&mdash;5, The experience of
believers.&mdash;6, The salvation of children.&nbsp; This good
man was chosen and ordained for the glory of God, and for the
benefit of his people; eternally chosen in Christ to salvation;
he was impressed with the power of converting grace in very early
life, and long before he was introduced to public notice, long
before his elevation to the throne of Israel.&nbsp; No doubt,
while a youth, the holy Spirit took possession of his heart, and
led his mind to hope in the promised Messiah, for life and
salvation, and being selected from the busy world, and the cares,
vanities, and snares of the court, he had many sweet moments in
the sacred enjoyment of his God.&nbsp; <i>Times</i>, his mind
often afterwards reflected upon with heaven-felt pleasure.&nbsp;
It appears God had endowed him with astonishing skill in music,
and a sublime talent for poetry, so that he probably filled his
leisure hours with close attention to the exercise of those
gifts; and as Mr. Toplady strikingly remarks, on David&rsquo;s
composing this beautiful pastoral psalm: We must form to
ourselves an idea of David, the stripling, and think we see him
watching his flocks on a summer&rsquo;s night, under the expanded
canopy of the skies.&nbsp; The air is still, the heavens are
serene, the moon arrived at her full, is pursuing her majestic
silent course, the stars, like peeresses, on a coronation
solemnity, assume their brightest robes, to attend the beauteous
sovereign of the night, while both moon and stars concur to shed
a soft undazzling lustre on all the subjacent landscape.&nbsp;
David, at this happy period, a blameless youth, unpoisoned with
ambition, and unfacinated by the witchcraft of court corruption,
and his hands undipped in blood, is seated on a rising hillock,
or on the protuberant root of some stately tree.&nbsp; All is
hushed, not a bough rustles, not a leaf <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>trembles to the breeze; the silent
flocks are either carelessly grazing by his side, or slumbering
securely at his feet.&nbsp; The birds have suspended their songs,
until waked by the superior sweetness of his voice, and the music
of his hand; for, charmed with the loveliness of the scene, and
wrapt by the holy Spirit into a seraphic flame of exalted
devotion, he has lain aside his crook&mdash;he has taken up his
harp, and transmitting to the throne of God, these grateful,
these inexpressibly beautiful lines contained in this psalm, this
divine testimony of Jesus, although perhaps wrote more than a
thousand years before his incarnation.&nbsp; David&rsquo;s mind
was illuminated with spiritual knowledge, his faith centering in
the Messiah, his hope resting on his covenant engagements, his
affections cleaving to him, his mind at this time, happy in his
love; and astonished at the infinite condescension of the God of
all grace, in looking upon him in early life; saving him from the
follies of youth, converting his soul, anointing him though a
stripling, to be a king; working deliverance for him, when by a
supernatural power upon him, he slew a lion at one time, and a
bear at another.&nbsp; Surely as his heart glowed at the
reflection, his mouth spoke forth the high praises of the Lord;
and as God was his strength, so he had ordained the effects of it
for the glory of his own name, that he might be praised and
adored, and that the enemies of the Lord and his people might be
confounded.&nbsp; This was frequently the case in the wars of
David, but particularly while a stripling; and in comparison to
men of war, he was but a babe or suckling, when he went to meet
Goliah, the gigantic champion of the Philistines, who for forty
days gave a challenge to decide the fate of the war by a single
combat, defying them to produce a man in the whole army of Israel
that dare engage him.&nbsp; The Lord stirred up the mind of this
pious youth, this shepherd&rsquo;s boy, the son of Jesse, to
attack this unwieldy monster, near eleven feet <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>high, and
covered with brass.&nbsp; David, armed with divine power and
skill, and encouraged by his God, went forth to meet the
insulting foe, and slung a stone, which being divinely directed,
sunk into his forehead, and brought him to the ground.&nbsp;
Surely, in reading the whole history, we may see the text
evidently fulfilled, and sweetly confirmed; but surely, if the
power, glory, and faithfulness of God were so eminently seen in
the victory given to this babe; out of whose mouth God was
glorified, and his enemies stilled, silenced, overcome, and
defeated, how much more so in the instance of David&rsquo;s Lord,
who having taken our nature into union with his divine person, is
called the Holy Child, Jesus, (Acts iv, 27) by whom God had
ordained his highest glory, the honor of all his perfections, in
a way of grace, in the salvation of innumerable millions.&nbsp;
And are we not often led to contemplate the appearance of this
holy child?&nbsp; When but a babe, as it were, we find him in the
temple, disputing with the learned doctors there, hearing them,
and asking them questions about many points in the laws of Moses,
and probably many important questions concerning the promised
Messiah; and all that heard him were astonished at his
understanding, and answers.&nbsp; Out of his sacred lips God
ordained his <i>truth</i>, his <i>word</i>, his <i>will</i>
should be known.&nbsp; May we not see this accomplished by the
mouth of his ministry, miracles, praises, and prayers?&nbsp; And
those who were taught of God, wondered at the gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth.&nbsp; His lips were like
lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh, when he opened his mouth
and taught, and blest his people.&nbsp; Every doctrine he
preached, every invitation he gave, every truth he taught, every
declaration he made, every word he spoke, was truly blessed, of
everlasting importance, and for the glory of God.&nbsp; His
prayers and intercessions for his dear people were ever prevalent
with God, while every tear he shed, every sigh <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>he heaved,
every groan he uttered, every stripe, and every pain, with every
drop of blood which he shed, were as so many mouths pleading for
all who believe in him; and now he lives in glory, he appears
before the throne in the full virtue and dignity of his sacrifice
and obedience, pleading for all that come to God through him,
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession with God for
them.&nbsp; By his infinitely meritorious obedience to the law,
and by his bearing its dreadful penalties, he stilled the
avenger, the curse of a broken law, and the insulted justice of
God.&nbsp; He made full satisfaction by enduring the curse, being
made a curse for us, so that the threatening being thus executed
upon the surety, and justice satisfied, it can no longer pursue
that poor sinner, who flies to the city of refuge, to lay hold on
the hope set before him; and this city is divinely set forth in
these blessed Scriptures: A man shall be as an hiding place from
the wind, a refuge from the storm.&nbsp; The eternal God is thy
refuge.&nbsp; Christ, God-man, mediator, is the refuge.&nbsp;
Here the righteous flee, and are safe from the avenger of
blood.&nbsp; God, revealed in a broken law, is an enemy to
sinners as such, just as a judge is to a guilty criminal; but
when viewed as reconciled, and well pleased we see him well
pleased with us in him; the Father looks upon us in Christ, views
us holy, and pronounces us righteous; as a man looking up a wall,
or on any object through a red glass, it appears red; so are we
view in Christ.&nbsp; Ye are complete in him, having forgiven us
all trespasses&mdash;Christ having finish the work, overcome all
enemies, disappointed Satan, bruised his head, and took away his
power; drew the envenomed dart of death, barred the mouth of hell
from his people, overcome the grave; put an end to sin, and
triumphed over death in his own dominions; he has for ever
stilled the enemy and the avenger, and fulfilled the purposes,
and gracious decrees <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of God, respecting the redemption of
his chosen.&nbsp; Worthy is the lamb that was slain! how great
his love, how infinite his condescension, how eminent his
victories, but how dreadful an evil must sin be,</p>
<blockquote><p>How damnable must sin appear,<br />
If we reflect how dear<br />
It cost the Saviour to atone<br />
For all our weight of guilt,<br />
For sin his precious blood was spilt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scripture was also divinely fulfilled, when our Lord rode
in triumph to Jerusalem, as related by the evangelist.&nbsp;
Having sent two of his disciples to fetch him an ass and a colt,
he sat thereon.&nbsp; While vast multitudes were collected, and
attended him in the way to the city, some laid their cloaths on
the beast, others cast them on the ground for him to ride over,
and many cut down branches of palm trees to adorn his entrance
into the city, the children in the temple sung their hosannas to
the Redeemer, in harmony with the loud shouts and acclamations of
the populace.&nbsp; The Pharisees, those most inveterate enemies
of Christ, who had been a little mortified just before, by the
display of the power and Godhead of Christ, in raising Lazarus
from the dead, were still more so, on beholding the triumphant
entrance of Jesus, the approbation of the people, and the anthem
of the children.&nbsp; They had the daring effrontery to ask him,
hearest thou what those children say?&nbsp; The Saviour said, And
did you never read, that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
thou hast perfected praise?&nbsp; Here was the real literal
fulfilment of this text, for the Redeemer on this occasion,
stilled and silenced those enemies and avengers.&nbsp; This
triumphant entrance was indeed an emblem of his future
exaltation.&nbsp; The animal which bore Him perhaps intended to
shew the <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>characters he would make use of to bear his name in the
Jewish and Gentile worlds, and amongst all persons, high and low,
rich and poor, learned and illiterate.&nbsp; The conduct of the
people in casting their cloaths from them, to shew the effect
that grace has upon the heart, in causing the soul to renounce
its own righteousness, as more fit for the feet of an ass, than
to recommend it to God; while the branches of palms which they
bore were ensigns of the future victories which the
all-conquering captain of our salvation would gain over all his
enemies.&nbsp; And the very songs of the children, the prayers,
and the praises which would ascend from his redeemed in the
temple of his church, in all future generations.&nbsp; Their
hosannas were a prayer for salvation in all its
branches&mdash;save Lord, I beseech thee! and it was a wishing
success, and prosperity to his kingdom.&nbsp; These two are found
together in the souls of the called children of God.&nbsp; Where
there is prayer for our own souls, there is an earnest desire for
the increase of the Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom, and a hearty
welcoming his visits: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord.&nbsp; This is the soul&rsquo;s echo to the pleasing
tidings: Behold the king cometh unto thee.&nbsp; May not this
group of children, singing the praises of the adorable Messiah,
though perhaps unconscious of the meaning, be a beautiful figure
of that vast body of children who are saved by his grace, and
shout his fame, his love, and his victories, in the temple of
heaven for ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Babes, thither caught from womb and breast,<br />
Claim&rsquo;d right to sing above the rest,<br />
Because they found that happy shore<br />
They never saw nor sought before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And surely God has ordained the praise of his own grace in the
salvation of children, and this will be confessed for <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>ever by them,
to the eternal confusion of those who live and die despisers of
salvation by grace.&nbsp; Here, such enemies will be confounded
in beholding the freeness, the sovereignty, riches, and victories
of electing, redeeming, calling, and glorifying grace: for Out of
the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast ordained strength,
because of thine enemies.</p>
<p>I humbly conceive this beautiful passage may, with propriety,
be applied to the apostles, and first ministers of our
Lord.&nbsp; This was a name he was pleased to them.&nbsp; The
great head of the church having chosen his twelve apostles, it
pleased him to call and appoint seventy disciples besides, in
allusion to Moses choosing twelve princes and seventy elders in
the wilderness.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus sent them out two by two,
and giving them power to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal
the sick, they went forth and did as Jesus commanded them.&nbsp;
Upon their return, and laying their labours at his feet,
astonished at their success, that it exceeded their expectations,
even to the casting out of devils.&nbsp; At that time Jesus
rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise
and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes&mdash;even so
Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.&nbsp; These ministers
of Christ are called babes, weak, ignorant, and foolish, when
compared with what they should be after the day of Pentecost, or
when compared with the wise ones of this world, men of great
natural gifts, wisdom, sagacity, penetration, and skill, in
natural things; but these were babes in comparison to such
knowing ones, and they were babes in their own esteem, weak,
defenceless, impotent, dependent, and knowing little or nothing
in their own opinion, yet humble, docile, and teachable, sitting
at their master&rsquo;s feet, and looking to him for divine <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>teaching.&nbsp; It was out of the mouths of these
persons God had ordained the gospel to be preached, and this is
called the rod of his strength&mdash;the power of God to
salvation in every one that believeth.&nbsp; Their testimony was
plain and simple, but it did wonders in the world.&nbsp; Nor can
there be a greater proof of the divine authenticity of the word
of God, than the work it has accomplished, for in the hands of
the holy Spirit, and by the preaching of it, proud, profane,
prejudiced, and carnal persons, have been humbled, subdued,
quickened, illuminated, made holy, saved.&nbsp; The wolf has been
brought to lay down at the feet of the Lamb of God, the cow and
the bear.&nbsp; The ministers of Christ, and a raging tyrant by
nature, have walked together! yea, a little child has led those
fierce characters into all truth! (Isaiah xi.)&nbsp;
Instrumentally, such enemies have been subdued, changed, and
become distinguished monuments of sovereign, converting
grace.&nbsp; The New Testament is full of those instances, and
millions in heaven, and thousands upon earth, have felt the power
of a gospel ministry.&nbsp; This is most strikingly remarked by
the apostle: But if all prophecy, or preach, and there came in
one that believeth not, or unlearned, he is convinced of all,
judged of all, and thus are the secrets of his heart made
manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship, and
report that God is in you of a truth, because the same Almighty
power is put forth in the word, that called light out of darkness
at the creation, and that called Lazarus from the tomb.&nbsp;
Nothing short of this, can produce any good effect upon the
understanding, the will, the affections, the mind, and conscience
of a sinner.&nbsp; What powerful reproofs, cutting convictions,
consoling influences, supporting and delivering power, have been
felt by the Lord&rsquo;s people, in hearing and reading the
gospel of Jesus, whether in the Old or the New Testament.&nbsp;
And this has cast out Satan, and sin&rsquo;s dominion, tyranny,
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>power
guilt, and distress, from the soul; has answered many an
accusation, freed from many a doubt, and overcome the enemy and
the avenger.&nbsp; This is no small mortification to that
implacable foe, to see the astonishing power and success of the
gospel, and himself, at times, put to flight, by a simple act of
faith in God&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh! I have seen the day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When with a single word,<br />
God helping me to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My trust is in the Lord;<br />
My soul has slain a thousand foes,<br />
Fearless of all that could oppose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For so the promise runs, and so the victorious believer has
found it.&nbsp; One of you shall chase a thousand (by the word,)
and two of you (by faith and prayer), shall put ten thousand to
flight.</p>
<p>Blessed be God for the gospel, and for its power and influence
upon our hearts.&nbsp; This is the sweet evidence of our eternal
election of God, for our gospel came not unto you in word only,
but in power; in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance.&nbsp; It
is in this way, even a babe in Christ has stilled the enemy and
the avenger.&nbsp; The people of the Most High are called babes;
and little children, being born again, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, but of God&mdash;created anew in Christ Jesus,
unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should
walk in them.&nbsp; This new birth is produced by the almighty
power of God, the holy making Spirit.&nbsp; It is an evidence of
everlasting love, and of the soul&rsquo;s interest in the blood
and righteousness of Christ; and none have any right to consider
themselves in Christ, who are strangers to the new birth.&nbsp;
It is the gracious indwelling of the holy Spirit <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>in his divine
influences&mdash;forming a new man of grace&mdash;a new
heart&mdash;a right spirit, infusing every holy principle, in
conformity to the image, of Christ.&nbsp; When this work is begun
in most of God&rsquo;s children, it is hard to tell, but some
blessed effects of it may be clearly seen.&nbsp; Such souls, may
be long under the terror of the law, the bondage of their spirit,
the fears of death, the dread of judgment, eternity and hell, yet
the Lord hears their groans, sees their oppressions, tears, and
fears, and will in due time, bring them out of prison.&nbsp;
Some, indeed, are led on more smoothly, but none are left
ignorant of their lost state by nature, their condemnation by the
law, and the value of Christ, as the atonement and righteousness
of his people.&nbsp; Such babes are humble, simple, sincere, and
teachable; they desire the breast of consolation, from heart-felt
misery; they desire the sincere milk of the word, not only the
word, but the <i>milk</i> of it, that they may grow thereby into
a deeper knowledge of Christ, till their faith is grown up to
full assurance, and their hope big with expectations; till a
sense of divine love casts out all doubts and fears, which sadly
torment their minds, and till they know the whole armour of God;
and surely there can be no actual enjoyment with Christ, or
entering into truth, or the privileges of the gospel, or into
eternal glory, till this new birth takes place.&nbsp; There can
be neither <i>seeing</i> nor <i>entering</i> the kingdom; there
may be a superficial knowledge, and plenty of talk about truth;
but it is a cordial reception of it in the heart, and digesting
it in the mind, that will ever produce any good effect, either in
the soul, or in the conversation.&nbsp; And except we become as
little children, we can in no wise enter the kingdom; but having
been blessed with this divine change in the heart, confession is
to be made to the glory of God.&nbsp; This is the ordinance of
Heaven: there is to be an acknowledgement of the truth, a
declaration of what God has done for <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>us to the church, to one another; and
when prudent opportunity offers, before the world, by words, and
by facts, open and visible, sincere and hearty, likewise in
prayer; and praise, when the Lord is pleased to give us strength
so to do, that others may be led to see that there is a reality
in religion, and may be blessed with the strength of grace to
seek the Lord, and glorify God in the day of their visitation: in
so doing, you still the enemy, and by a God-glorifying conduct,
put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, the enemies of God
and truth.&nbsp; And where the conscience is made tender, every
thing that is contrary to this, is a source of inconceivable
grief.&nbsp; These babes are at times, also enabled to silence
Satan himself, with all the accusations of a distressed and
burdened conscience, when the atonement, obedience, love, person,
offices and promises, invitations and faithfulness of the dear
Redeemer is powerfully brought into the mind, by the holy Spirit,
and strength given to baffle the enemy, with his satanic
suggestions, as a young man did lately, upon his death bed,
depending upon, and pleading the great work of Christ, for his
acceptance with God, just going into eternity.&nbsp; The enemy
plagued him with this question continually: &rsquo;Tis true
Christ died for sinners! but how do you know he died for
you?&nbsp; The young man had strength given him to answer the
enemy as fast as he plagued him!&nbsp; But, Satan, how do you
know he did not?&nbsp; Thus he gained the victory over the enemy,
and died in sweet confidence.&nbsp; Thanks be to God, who giveth
us the victory, for out of the mouths of such babes he has
ordained his own glory.&nbsp; It is also evident, that God is
glorified by the displays of the riches, power, and freeness of
grace, in the salvation of children.&nbsp; This must be favor
indeed, as such can perform no act of demotion to recommend them
to God! nor can their innocence do it, as they are conceived in
sin, born, or shapen in iniquity, under the imputation of the
guilt of <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Adam, and with the seeds of every sin in them that can
be committed in this world, though guilty of no actual
transgression, yet by nature they are sinners, destitute of the
image of God, and under guilt.&nbsp; How great that grace which
chose them&mdash;how infinitely dear that blood which redeemed
them&mdash;and how condescending that holy Spirit that takes
possession of them before their little souls leave their bodies:
they are to be considered, passively, the capable subjects of
converting grace&mdash;and who can tell what passes on the soul
of a departing infant, under the operations of the spirit of
God?&nbsp; Millions of infants are, doubtless, before the throne
of God, and the Lamb, praising, adoring, and blessing that mercy
that saved them so early, not on account of their natural purity,
nor their religious descent&mdash;not because their parents were
pious persons, for this can make no difference&mdash;nor because
they were superstitiously baptized, as it is erroneously called,
but because God has set his love upon them&mdash;because they are
interested in the covenant of grace&mdash;because the Redeemer
has died for them&mdash;his righteousness is imputed to
them&mdash;and because the holy Spirit takes possession of their
hearts&mdash;sanctifies them in a moment&mdash;and because God
has ordained the glory of himself, in the everlasting salvation
and happiness of those who are not able to save themselves.&nbsp;
I acknowledge the salvation of all infants has been a subject of
dispute, amongst many, and Satan has taken the advantage to
distress many a parent upon the subject.&nbsp; But secret things
belong to the Lord, our God, the things that are revealed belong
to us.&nbsp; Here we want grace to rest, yet I am bold to affirm,
that we have no one solid proof of the everlasting destruction of
an infant.&nbsp; It is no where positively <i>asserted</i> nor
yet <i>implied</i>.&nbsp; I am now speaking of babes.&nbsp;
Millions have been destroyed in public calamities, and died a
corporeal death, but not punished with an everlasting death; nor
can we find any infants <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>amongst those of whom it is affirmed,
that they suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.&nbsp; It was
David&rsquo;s consolation that his child was saved, though born
under adulterous circumstances.&nbsp; I shall go to him, but he
shall not return to me.&nbsp; This does not refer to the grave,
for there could be but little pleasure in that thought, but to
eternal rest.&nbsp; The pious Shunamite woman said of the death
of her son, It is well.&nbsp; And the Lord promised that that son
of Jereboam should go to his grave, because in that child there
was found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel.&nbsp;
Thousands of dear children were massacred by order of Herod, with
an intent to murder the Redeemer.&nbsp; These dear children were
the first martyrs for Christ, and the Lord assures us of their
salvation, (Jeremiah xxxi, 15, 16, 17.) to which I refer
you.&nbsp; The <i>border</i> there spoken of, is most undoubtedly
the millennium, the heavenly country, where these precious stones
would adorn the crown of the Redeemer, and be everlasting
monuments of the wonders of his grace.&nbsp; These dear children
will to eternity, acknowledge how infinitely indebted they are to
the adorable trinity in unity, for so great a salvation.</p>
<blockquote><p>And now they range the heavenly plains,<br />
And sing his love in melting strains;<br />
Or, overwhelm&rsquo;d with rapture sweet,<br />
Sink down adoring at his feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I come now to speak of the closing scene of my much-loved
son.&nbsp; On this subject I want much fortitude and power from
on high, to sustain my deeply affected heart.&nbsp; None but God
knows the strange mixture of my feelings, grief and gratitude,
sorrow and wonder.&nbsp; I have not room here to enlarge on the
subject of nature and affection, and the feelings these ties
inspire in the loss of one so dear to my heart.&nbsp; Cruel
memory recals to mind a <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>thousand endearments, in such
departed worth, but I fall at the footstool of divine mercy, and
bless the God of all grace, that I am not sorrowing as one
without hope.&nbsp; Many whom I am now addressing, knew him well,
and all who knew him loved him.&nbsp; He was beloved of his
God&mdash;blest from infancy with peculiar powers, which no doubt
would have shown brightly in life, had he been spared.&nbsp; But
though the subject of deep affliction, yet grace shone in his
mind, and its radiance was sweetly emitted to an eminent manner,
as his afflictions abounded.&nbsp; He was the last son of his
dear mother, who is in glory; and being favored at his birth with
a peculiar answer to prayer, I adopted the method of ancient
believers, on extraordinary occasions, and called him Samuel,
<i>heard of God</i>! and so he proved to be.&nbsp; About six
years ago, he broke his leg, which afterwards produced great
weakness through the fright; the pain, and long
confinement.&nbsp; This had a serious effect upon his whole mass
of blood, which afterwards shewed itself in several
abscesses.&nbsp; These baffled all the skill of medicine, and
though well attended by medical persons, and most tenderly and
carefully nursed, and watched by day and by night, yet God had
determined to bring him to glory, at nearly twelve years of age,
nor can I wish him back again.</p>
<blockquote><p>To be with dire afflictions tost and tore,<br />
The suffering little boy he was before!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But during the last months he was with his kind affectionate,
attentive Aunt and Uncle, who have been long in the ways of God,
and have had a most clear and blessed experience of grace and
truth themselves, they were often highly delighted to see the
work of grace so eminently displayed in their dear little
suffering nephew.&nbsp; Many precious things he said to me, but
as a father, perhaps it <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>might be attributed to weakness, or
an inordinate affection for a son, if I made any remarks.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis however very pleasing to me that his dear Aunt was
enabled to seize a few opportunities, secretly, to pen down some
of those words which fell from him at times.&nbsp; A few only,
can be asserted here, but which plainly indicates the work of
grace upon his heart, by the confession of his lips, and sweetly
proving, that out of the mouth of this dear child God had
ordained his own glory.</p>
<p>The contents of the following letter, sent to me by his Aunt,
I beg leave also to insert, without a single comment of my
own.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,</p>
<p>Believing you would be desirous of knowing the dealings of the
Lord with your dear child, I have endeavored to preserve a small
part of what fell from his lips during the last weeks of his
afflicted life.&nbsp; I say a small part, because the whole, had
it not been for the necessary and close attention to his person,
would have swelled a volume.</p>
<p>Previous to the time when he was confined to his bed, which
was the latter end of December, when I had an opportunity to set
with him, he would often talk on divine subjects, and appeared
deeply interested in the things that pertained to his own
salvation.&nbsp; He mentioned several sermons he had heard Dr.
Andrews, of Walworth, preach, but particularly one, from, Oh my
Dove, that art in the cleft of the rock.&nbsp; He ran through the
several ideas that was advanced, with great correctness and
interest.&nbsp; At another time when we were conversing about
eternal things, he <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>said, Aunt, I should not be afraid to die, if I was sure
I had an interest in Christ!&nbsp; You know it is possible to be
deceived, and many people are.&nbsp; I never said so much to any
one as I have to you.&nbsp; I talked to my dear father, and he
answered me much the same as you have.</p>
<p>About the middle of February, when helping him out of bed,
very helpless, and in great pain, he said, Aunt, I seem to have a
hope that I shall be saved!&nbsp; Do you not think that answer to
prayer is some evidence? and I am sure that many of my poor
simply prayers have been answered.</p>
<p>February 26.&mdash;He held a truly interesting conversation
with his Uncle, expressing the strongest desire to know if he was
truly drawn to Christ!&nbsp; On the evidences being given to him,
he appeared much refreshed, and said, It may be when I am nearer
to death that the Lord may give me a full assurance.&nbsp; He
often said how good the Lord is; I have more to be thankful for
than to complain of!&nbsp; Once he said, Well Aunt, who can tell
but the Lord may cure me? and if he does not, he will do a great
deal better for me!&mdash;But for want of time, I must omit many
very blessed things, and relate what more particularly transpired
towards the close.&nbsp; The few last days in February, and the
first and second of March, he was in great pain, and there was an
evident alteration for the worst.&nbsp; In the night of the
second of March, he said, Oh! affliction! affliction!&nbsp; My
poor body is quite worn out!&nbsp; Oh! I wish for more patience
and resignation.&nbsp; Aunt, I had rather lay here, with all my
pains, than be running about the streets, in health, like many
boys I know, cursing and swearing, and sinning against God.&nbsp;
In the same night, he said, Oh! I hope we shall meet in
Heaven!&nbsp; On my expressing the same hope, he cried out, Ah!
but I want more than hope!&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>I want assurance!&nbsp; Oh! I hope
the Lord will sanctify this affliction.</p>
<p>Lord&rsquo;s day, March the third.&mdash;He asked me to
read.&nbsp; After reading the word, and some hymns, he smiled,
and said, How precious that is!&nbsp; I wish you had nothing else
to do but to talk and read to me.&nbsp; In the evening of that
day, he was in great pain.&nbsp; From twelve at night till three
in the morning, his tongue was like the pen of a
ready-writer.&nbsp; I said to him, My dear, have you long had
serious thoughts about your soul?&nbsp; He answered, No, Aunt,
not any thing particularly, till within a twelvemonth.&nbsp; How
was it at the beginning with you?&nbsp; Why, I was very much
alarmed for fear I should go to hell!&nbsp; I used to have such
dark horror on my mind as I cannot describe!&nbsp; I used to cry
till I fell asleep, and then I used to dream it was the day of
judgment, and wake very much terrified!&nbsp; I dreamt this a
great many times.&nbsp; I cannot tell you what I went through,
with the dark horror at day, and the terrifying dreams at
night.&nbsp; Did you not feel at times, hopes springing up, that
the Lord would save you, through Christ Jesus?&nbsp; Yes, very
often, when I have been hearing my father, and Dr. Andrews, but
afterwards I have been much distressed, for fear they were not
right hopes.&nbsp; I never talked about what I felt.&nbsp; I
thought people might think as I was a child that I heard a great
deal about religion, it was what I had picked up&mdash;then
added, with a strong voice and great satisfaction, But I know
that what I picked up <i>then</i>, does me good <i>now</i>!&nbsp;
Aunt, the last time I sung that hymn, Ah! I shall soon be dying,
I never sung so in my life!&nbsp; I sung and cried!&nbsp; I sung
as if I had another voice besides my own&mdash;I was so full of
joy.&mdash;I spoke to Him of the great love of God, in calling
him to the knowledge of himself, and bringing him to Jesus, for
life and salvation.&nbsp; He replied, Oh! it is a great
love.&nbsp; I keep you awake, but my heart is so full that I
cannot help <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>talking.&nbsp; This is but a small part of what passed
on that, to me, memorable night.</p>
<p>March the 4th.&mdash;A young man was saying, when he was about
thirteen years of age, he was so ill that used to pray to
die.&nbsp; Samuel remarked after he was gone, That he did not
know what death was, nor what it was to have a hell in his heart,
or else he would not talk so.&mdash;Aunt, what a very precious
hymn that is: All the fitness he requireth, is to feel your need
of Him.&mdash;Oh! I hope I shall be able to say, as dear Mrs.
Lawson said, when near death, I know in whom I have
believed.&mdash;I hope my father will not grieve when I
die&mdash;why should he?&nbsp; He often said, O that my warfare
was ended.</p>
<p>March the 5th.&mdash;Very comfortable all day.&nbsp; About
eleven at night, he suffered much.&nbsp; He said, Oh! I am quite
worn out!&nbsp; I hope I shall not be long.&nbsp; It seems as if
I could leave all now&mdash;Aunt, I can leave you!&nbsp; I hope I
shall not suffer much at last&mdash;do you think I shall?&nbsp; I
do not think you will my dear, but in all your sufferings the
Lord will support you; you are not without sweet support now, are
you?&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; I am greatly supported, What a mercy it
is to have promises to rest on.&nbsp; Oh! I want to go&mdash;not
so much to get rid of suffering, as to see Jesus, which is
better.&nbsp; Adding, Aunt, this is a comfort to me, you will not
be long after me, nor uncle neither.&mdash;Once, when holding him
up in my arms, he feared I should let him fall and cried out,
Hold me up, hold me up!&nbsp; After a short pause, in a very
expressive manner, said, Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe;
and then to me, As thy day is, so shall thy strength be.</p>
<p>One day, he said, I have longed when I have seen people go
down into the water to be baptized, to go too.&nbsp; <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>He was
answered, That there was no salvation in water.&nbsp; He replied,
Oh! I know that, but you know it is so sweet to follow the
Lord!&nbsp; At another time, he said, Aunt, I have a secret hope,
that if I was to recover, the Lord would never let me forget his
goodness to me; these afflictions would be useful to me through
life.&nbsp; Once, when in great pain, he said, Its only
weaning&mdash;I want a great deal of weaning.&nbsp; Oh what a
mercy to be reconciled to the will of the Lord.&nbsp; The Lord is
very good.</p>
<p>The following Saturday, when lifting him into bed, he said,
Oh! Aunt, may the Lord give me patience, and you strength.&nbsp;
I answered, I believe he will.&nbsp; And though we could mot see
the end of the Lord, in thus afflicting him, yet if not before,
we should in the light of glory.&nbsp; He answered, What a mercy
to know we are going there.&nbsp; I hope my dear you know for
yourself, you are going there?&nbsp; He replied with great
firmness, Yes, I can say I believe I am.&mdash;And last night
(alluding to some hours of great pain and agony) he said, If I
could have spoken, though my poor body was so much afflicted, and
my patience almost gone, I could have said, I know I am going to
glory!&nbsp; He added, If I am not deceived, I hope I am
not.&nbsp; Oh! what a great thing to be reconciled to the will
God.&nbsp; Oh! pray for me, that I may have more patience to hold
out.</p>
<p>March 26.&mdash;For several hours in great extremity of pain,
but declared himself happy in soul.&mdash;Something having been
said about faith, he answered, Ah! it is easy enough to talk
about faith, but to be afflicted as I am, then we see how little
faith we have got.&nbsp; Oh! Aunt, pray for me?&nbsp; Ask the
Lord, Oh! do, do!&nbsp; Observe, this latter expression, Ask the
Lord, was continually his request.&nbsp; I once said to him, then
you believe the Lord heareth prayer?&nbsp; He answered with great
quickness, Yes, and <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>answering too.&nbsp; Being encouraged not to fear, he
said, But sometimes I have fears!&nbsp; But why art thou cast
down, Oh my soul?&nbsp; This day, when much distressed in body,
he said, But why should I complain?&nbsp; What did the Lord
suffer?</p>
<blockquote><p>He sunk beneath our heavy woes<br />
To raise us to a throne;<br />
There&rsquo;s not a gift his hand bestows,<br />
But cost his heart a groan!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 28.&mdash;He said, Aunt, I am not desirous to live, but
I hope I shall not go off in agony.&nbsp; Oh! Oh! let me be the
subject of your prayers, continually!&nbsp; Oh! spend all your
time in wrestling for me.</p>
<p>Lord&rsquo;s day, March 31.&mdash;In the afternoon a few
friends came to see him, and a few hours he was cheerful, and
free from pain.&nbsp; About ten, his pains became
intolerable.&nbsp; It was a time of great distress.&nbsp; Between
eleven and twelve, he became more easy, and a sweet colour
appeared in his countenance.&nbsp; He said, Aunt, when I am in
glory I shall sing as loud as any one, The crowned Lord of
all.&nbsp; Oh! I long to go&mdash;I long to be singing
hallelujah!&nbsp; He then sung Hallelujah, hallelujah!&nbsp; He
then repeated the whole of the hymn, Grace, &rsquo;tis a charming
theme; laying a particular emphasis on the words, Wrote my
name&mdash;repeating (<i>My name</i>).&nbsp; Oh! I long to be
singing.&nbsp; Crown him Lord of all!&nbsp; Calling to his Uncle
in the next room, to come, Crown him Lord of all!&nbsp; On its
being complied with, he joined with the sweetest voice.&nbsp; On
our retiring to the next room, he sung alone, in a soft voice, a
great part of the hymn, called Gethsemane.&nbsp; He then called,
Uncle; come and sing again?&nbsp; On his replying, My dear; I am
very low, he said, never mind, I will help you!&nbsp; He then
sweetly joined in, <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Grace, &rsquo;tis a charming sound.&nbsp; At the
conclusion, he said, It is all of grace.&nbsp; Oh! I long to
Crown him Lord of all!&nbsp; He requested his Uncle to go to
prayer?&nbsp; When concluded, he shook him by the hand, saying, I
thank you, I thank you.&mdash;Monday.&mdash;Extremely low all
day.&nbsp; On turning him in bed, he said, Oh! what should I do
without you? but instantly added, in a louder voice, What should
I do without the Lord?</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 2nd.&mdash;A day full of pain and distress
indeed.&nbsp; About noon, he said, I shall not be long
here!&nbsp; I expressed a hope of meeting him in glory.&nbsp; He
answered, Yes, I do not fear that.&nbsp; I replied, yes, for He
is able to save to the uttermost.&nbsp; He replied, If he has not
saved you, he never will&mdash;adding, Saved from the beginning
of the world!&nbsp; What a mercy Aunt, to be in
Christ?&mdash;Wednesday.&mdash;Very low all day.&nbsp; Several
times in the day he expressed a desire to depart, and be with
Christ.&nbsp; He cried out, Oh! this poor sinful body&mdash;a
body of sin and death!&mdash;Late at night, he sighed, and said,
Lord, what is man!&mdash;Thursday.&mdash;Suffered much all
day.&nbsp; About noon, he said, To-morrow is Good
Friday&mdash;Ah! what did the Lord suffer for us?&nbsp; And in a
very emphatic manner, said, Oh
Gethsemane!&mdash;Friday.&mdash;Evidently much worse.&nbsp; About
noon he was very restless.&nbsp; I said, My dear, who can place
your pillow easy?&nbsp; He replied, Only one God&mdash;must be my
physician.&nbsp; About noon, he said, Oh! pray to the Lord to
take me very soon?&nbsp; Then you are willing to go to him?&nbsp;
He replied, Yes, before tea time, if it was the Lord&rsquo;s
will!&nbsp; Oh that I could fall asleep in his arms.&nbsp; Oh!
wrestle Aunt, Oh! wrestle!&nbsp; On uttering a few short
petitions in his behalf, he affectionately thanked me, saying, Oh
that our united prayers may be answered.&nbsp; About three
o&rsquo;clock, he said, Oh! why doth he tarry so long?&nbsp; Oh
that <i>his chariot</i> was waiting for me!&nbsp; On assuring him
that was the case&mdash;that <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the holy angels were surrounding him,
to convey him before the throne of God and the Lamb, he cried, Oh
that he would come quickly!&nbsp; Oh! to hear the sound of his
chariot wheels!&nbsp; Why doth he tarry so long?&nbsp; When about
to fall asleep in his arms, he whispered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cease fond nature, cease thy strife,<br />
Let me languish into life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the evening spent in great pain, but fervent
expressions after the coming of the Lord, often crying, Oh! ask
the Lord why is his chariot so long in coming!&nbsp; About three
in the morning, he fell into a sleep, and without pain or groan,
sweetly fell asleep in Jesus.</p>
<p>Thus terminated the life of this believer in Jesus.&nbsp; May
you, and I, and all his dear friends, be partakers of the like
precious faith.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your&rsquo;s, most
affectionately,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><b><i>E. Bonner</i></b>.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Farewell, my dear son&mdash;and while I embalm thy memory with
tears, a Gospel hope points me to a time when I shall meet you
again, in the sacred blissful presence of a reigning Saviour, and
a smiling God.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
